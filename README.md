# analyzeText

Write a program that works with a text file. The aim of the program is to read a text from the text file and analyze it. Specifically it should count and print:

1. the number of words
2. the number of letters
3. the number of sentences
4. the most used letter in a text
5. the most used word in a text

For example if out text file contains this text: 
"Hello from C++ world"
the program should give the following output: 
Words: 4 
Letters: 15 (special characters and space are not counted)
Sentences: 1 
Letter frequency: o (both o and l are used 3 times so any of the letters is considered as a right answer)
Word frequency: 0 (there is no word that is used more than once)
The result should be kept in a separate text file.
